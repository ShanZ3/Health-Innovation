Description:<br>
* Apple Health app consolidates data from iPhone, Apple Watch, and third-party apps that the user already uses. The user can view all his or her progress in one convenient place. The app also provides long-term trends and daily details for a wide range of health metrics. Its offical website offers detailed explanation for its functionalities.

## Heuristic Evaluation
### 1): Visibility of system status
* The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time. <br>

>Comment: <br>
>* Apple Health app did a good job in providing feedback from users’ operations, letting the users know that their command has been executed: once the users click the button, the app will highlight and dent the clicked button to inform users that their operation has been received and executed. However, it does not provide a progress bar to tell the user how much time is needed, how many percentages are completed and what it is under processing, though it’s not a big problem since the app reacts fast. (2)

### 2): Match between system and the real world
* The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order. <br>

>Comment: <br>
>* Overall, the app provides a clear match between system and the real world. The information it presents can be easily understood by users and the icons it chose for different measures follow real-world conventions: for instance, it uses an heart icon to represent the measure of heart rate and a bed icon to represent the measure of sleep quality. However, its measure of headphone audio levels might not be familiar to the user since the graph it generated for headphone volume levels does not follow graphic conventions. (2)

### 3): User control and freedom
* Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo. <br>

>Comment: <br>
>* Apple Health app does allow users to delete their health records if they don’t want to keep them. It also allows users to manually change their health data if they made any mistakes. (1)

### 4): Consistency and standards
* Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.<br>

>Comment:<br>
>* Apple Health app uses same icon for vitals under health categories and clinical vitals under health records. To avoid confusions, perhaps it should choose different icons. (2)


### 5): Error prevention
* Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.<br>

>Comment:<br>
>* The app does not have a good error prevention design. When users enter obviously wrong health data (i.e.: >500 BPM), the app will not send any error message nor does it prevent users from adding the data to their health records. (2)

### 6): Recognition rather than recall
Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. <br>
Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.<br>

>Comment: <br>
>* It is easy for users to follow instructions for use of this app. There are only two buttons at the bottom of the interface  which direct users to find appropriate functions and therefore minimize users' memory load. (1)

### 7): Flexibility and efficiency of use
Accelerators — unseen by the novice user — may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions. <br>

>Comment: <br>
>* The app does not have high flexibility and effinciency of use. Every time when the users want to add or change their health data, they have to manually type thier records. The app does not endorse speach recognition and does not has hot keys, though it does allow users records to be imported from third party platform. (2)

### 8): Aesthetic and minimalist design
Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.<br>

>Comment:<br>
>* Apple Health app adopts minimalist style which allows features, operations and options to be clearly identified by users. However, it does contain rarely needed information such as organ donations. Perhaps such option is more suitable for real hospitals and shouldn't be listed in a health care app. (2)


### 9): Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution. <br>

>Comment:<br>
>* The app does not have any error messages and thus will not inform users what exactly is the problem. It also does not provide any suggestions for possible solutions. A good example of a typical error message in health app should notify users common ranges of health data they entered. (2)

### 10): Help and documentation
Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large. <br>

>Comment: <br>
>* Though the app does offer descriptions and explanations for each measures of body health, it does not provide help and documentation to guide users. Perhaps, it is more convenient to set up help documentations which include concrete steps to help users better understand how to use this app. 

## Overall Evaluation
* The Apple health app has a clear core functionality: measure and record a person’s health data. It does have comparetively comprehensive measures of health data which includes multiple health categories while also keeps good health record. The product framework and interfaces are designed minimalistically which minimize users' memory load. However, this app does not has error messages to locate errors, nor does it has help documentations to provide guide for users to use this app.
